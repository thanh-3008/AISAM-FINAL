Guideline to make and understand Unit Test Case																									
																									
1. Overview																									
 - In the template, Unit test cases are based on functions. Each sheet presents test cases for one function.																									
 - Cover: General information of the project and Unit Test cases																									
" - FunctionList: The list of Classes and Functions in the document. 
     + To control that the number of Unit TC meets customer's requirement or the norm, user should fill value for  
     'Normal number of Test cases/KLOC'. "																									
"     + Click on Function link to open the related Test cases of the function.  
     Note: You should create new Function sheet before creating the link"																									
" - Test Report: provive the overview results of Functions Unit test: Test coverage, Test successful coverage 
    (Summary, for normal/abnormal/boundary cases)"																									
     Note:  Should check the formula of "Sub Total" if you add more functions																									
																									
2. Content in Test function sheet																									
2.1 Combination of test cases.																									
 - To verify that number of Unit TC meets customer's requirement or not. User has to fill number LOC of tested function and fill value of 'Normal number test cases/KLOC' item in FunctionList sheet, which is required by customer or normal value. The number of lacked TC is shown in 'Lack of test cases' item.																									
 - If the number of Unit TC does not meet the requirement, creator should explain the reasons.																									
 - If the number of  'Normal number test cases/KLOC' item in FunctionList sheet is not recorded, the number in 'Lack of test cases' is not calculated.																									
																									
 2.2 Condition and confirmation of Test cases.																									
 Each test case is the combination of condition and confirmation.																									
a. Condition:																									
        - Condition is combination of precondition and values of inputs.																									
"        - Precondition: it is setting condition that must exist before execution of the test case. 
                    Example: file A is precondition for the test case that needs to access file A."																									
        - Values of inputs: it includes 3 types of values: normal, boundary and abnormal.																									
                . Normal values are values of inputs used mainly and usually to ensure the function works.																									
                . Boundary values are limited values that contain upper and lower values.																									
                . Abnormal values are non-expected values. And normally it processes exception cases.   		 	 																						
        - For examples:																									
            Input value belongs to 5<= input <=10.																									
               . 6,7,8,9 are normal values.																									
               . 5, 10 are boundary values.																									
               . -1, 11,... are abnormal values.   		 																							
b. Confirmation: 																									
"        - It is combination of expected result to check output of each function. 
          If the results are the same with confirmation, the test case is passed, other case it is failed. "																									
        - Confirmation can include:																									
                + Output result of the function.																									
                + Output log messages in log file.																									
                + Output screen message...																									
c. Type of test cases and result:																									
        - Type of test case: It includes normal, boundary and abnormal test cases. User selects the type based on the type of input data.																									
"        - Test case result: the actual output results comparing with the Confirmation.
                 P for Passed and F for Failed cases.
          It can 'OK' or 'NG' (it depends on habit of the teams or customers)"																									
																									
 2.3. Other items:																									
 - Function Code: it is ID of the function and updated automatically according to FunctionList sheet.																									
 - Function Name: it is name  of the function and updated automatically according to FunctionList sheet.																									
 - Created By: Name of creator.																									
 - Executed By: Name of person who executes the unit test																									
 - Lines of code: Number of Code line of the function.																									
 - Test requirement: Brief description about requirements which are tested in this function, it is not mandatory.
